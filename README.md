# Predicting Whether a Steam Game is Free

## Overview

Steam is a gaming storefront published by Valve and hosts well over 30,000 games created by hundreds of different game developers. Games can either be purchased at varying price points, or installed for free. Our project aims to use consumer sentiment, developer, genre, release year, and supported platforms to determine whether a game will be free or not. We then use these features to perform supervised machine learning on these features using logistic regression.

Our analysis determined that games that implemented family sharing, were single- or multiplayer, had Steam leaderboards, and were demos were most likely to be free games. By far the most influential category was whether the game had implemented family sharing.

### Running the Data Analysis

There are two ways to run this analysis.

#### 1. Using Docker

This project uses Docker to make the computational environment reproducible. The Docker image is defined by the `Dockerfile` in the root of the repository, and the image is automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub using the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/publish_docker_image.yml`.

First, clone this GitHub repository and navigate to the root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-DSCI-310-2025W2/dsci-310-group-15.git
cd dsci-310-group-15
```

Then, build the docker image: 
```bash
docker build -t dsci310-project .
```

Then, launch the container:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)":/home/rstudio/dsci-310-group-15 dsci310-project
```

After launching the container, open Jupyter Lab in your browser through the link in the terminal: `http://localhost:8888`


#### 2. Without using Docker
